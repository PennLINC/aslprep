Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
:abbr:`SDC (susceptibility-derived distortion correction)` methods usually try to
make a good estimate of the field inhomogeneity map.
The inhomogeneity map is directly related to the displacement of
a given pixel :math:`(x, y, z)` along the
:abbr:`PE (phase-encoding)` direction (:math:`d_\text{PE}(x, y, z)`), and is
proportional to the slice readout time (:math:`T_\text{ro}`)
and the field inhomogeneity (:math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)`)
as follows ([Jezzard1995]_, [Hutton2002]_):

  .. _eq_fieldmap:

  .. math::

      d_\text{PE}(x, y, z) = \gamma \Delta B_0(x, y, z) T_\text{ro} \qquad (1)

where :math:`\gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio.
Therefore, the displacements map :math:`d_\text{PE}(x, y, z)` can be estimated
either using the inhomogeneity map :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)` or
image registration (see below).

Correction methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The are five broad families of methodologies for mapping the field:

  1. **Phase Encoding POLARity** (*PEPOLAR*; also called *blip-up/blip-down*;
     :py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.pepolar.init_pepolar_unwarp_wf`):
     acquire at least two images with varying :abbr:`PE (phase-encoding)` directions so 
     the realization of distortion is different between each
     acquisition. The displacements map :math:`d_\text{PE}(x, y, z)` is
     estimated with an image registration process between the different
     :abbr:`PE (phase-encoding)` acquisitions, regularized by the
     readout time :math:`T_\text{ro}`.
     Corresponds to 8.9.4 of BIDS.
  2. **Direct B0 mapping sequences** (:py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.fmap.init_fmap_wf`):
     some sequences (such as :abbr:`SE (spiral echo)`)
     are able to measure the fieldmap :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)` directly.
     Corresponds to section 8.9.3 of BIDS.
  3. **Phase-difference B0 mapping** (:py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.phdiff.init_phdiff_wf`):
     to estimate the fieldmap :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)`,
     these methods   measure the phase evolution in time between two close
     :abbr:`GRE (Gradient Recall Echo)` acquisitions. Corresponds to the sections
     8.9.1 and 8.9.2 of the BIDS specification.
  4. **"Fieldmap-less" estimation** (experimental; :py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.syn.init_syn_sdc_wf`):
     *fMRIPrep* now experimentally supports displacement
     field estimation in the absence of fieldmaps via nonlinear registration.
  5. **Point-spread function acquisition**: Not supported by BIDS, and hence *fMRIPrep*.

In order to select the appropriate estimation workflow, the input BIDS dataset is
first queried to find the available field-mapping techniques
(see :py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.base.init_sdc_estimate_wf`).
Once the field-map (or the corresponding displacement field) is estimated, the
distortion can be accounted for 
(see :py:func:`~sdcflows.workflows.unwarp.init_sdc_unwarp_wf`).

Calculating the effective echo-spacing and total-readout time
.............................................................
To solve :ref:`(1) <eq_fieldmap>`, all methods (with the exception of the
fieldmap-less approach) will require information about the in-plane
speed of the :abbr:`EPI (echo-planar imaging)` scheme used in
acquisition by reading either the :math:`T_\text{ro}`
(total-readout time) or :math:`t_\text{ees}` (effective echo-spacing).
See corresponding implementations under *SDCFlows*:

  * :py:func:`~sdcflows.interfaces.fmap.get_ees`
  * :py:func:`~sdcflows.interfaces.fmap.get_trt`

From the phase-difference map to a field map
............................................
To solve :ref:`(1) <eq_fieldmap>` using a :ref:`phase-difference map <sdc_phasediff>`,
the field map :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)` can be derived from the phase-difference
map (:py:func:`~sdcflows.interfaces.fmap.phdiff2fmap`).
