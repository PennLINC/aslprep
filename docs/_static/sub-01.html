<dt>Anatomical data preprocessing</dt>
<dd><p>A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input BIDS dataset.The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with <code>N4BiasFieldCorrection</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="n4">(Tustison et al. 2010)</span>, distributed with ANTs 2.3.1 <span class="citation" data-cites="ants">(Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757)</span>, and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a <em>Nipype</em> implementation of the <code>antsBrainExtraction.sh</code> workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using <code>fast</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="fsl_fast">(FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001)</span>. Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through nonlinear registration with <code>antsRegistration</code> (ANTs 2.3.1), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following template was selected for spatial normalization: <em>ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c</em> [<span class="citation" data-cites="mni152nlin2009casym">Fonov et al. (2009)</span>, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym],</p>
</dd>
<dt>Functional data preprocessing</dt>
<dd><p>For each of the 1 ASL runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using <code>mcflirt</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">(FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, Jenkinson et al. 2002)</span>. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using <code>flirt</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="flirt">(FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, Jenkinson and Smith 2001)</span> with the boundary-based registration <span class="citation" data-cites="bbr">(Greve and Fischl 2009)</span> cost-function. Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying the transforms to correct for head-motion. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as <em>preprocessed BOLD in original space</em>, or just <em>preprocessed BOLD</em>. The CBF was quantified from <em>preproccessed</em> ASL data using a relatively basic model <span class="citation" data-cites="detre_perfusion_1992">(Detre et al. 1992)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="alsop_recommended_2015">(Alsop et al. 2015)</span>. CBF are susceptible to artifacts due to low signal to noise ratio and sensitivity to motion, Structural Correlation based Outlier Rejection (SCORE) algothim was applied to the CBF to discard few extreme outliers <span class="citation" data-cites="dolui2017structural">(Dolui et al. 2017)</span>. Furthermore,Structural Correlation with RobUst Bayesian (SCRUB) algorithms was applied to the CBF by iteratively reweighted CBF with structural tissues probalility maps <span class="citation" data-cites="dolui2016scrub">(Sudipto Dolui David A. Wolk and Detre 2016)</span>. Alternate method of CBF computation is Bayesian Inference for Arterial Spin Labeling (BASIL) as implmented in FSL which is based on Bayeisan inference principles <span class="citation" data-cites="chappell2008variational">(Chappell et al. 2009)</span>. BASIL computed the CBF from ASL incoporating natural varaibility of other model parameters and spatial regularization of the estimated perfusion image. BASIL also included correction for partial volume effects <span class="citation" data-cites="chappell_pvc">(Chappell et al. 2011)</span>. The ASL and CBF dreivatives were resampled into standard space, generating a <em>preprocessed ASL and computed CBF in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space</em>. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the <em>preprocessed ASL</em>: framewise displacement (FD) and DVARS. FD and DVARS are calculated for each ASL run, both using their implementations in <em>Nipype</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(following the definitions by Power et al. 2014)</span>. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following quality control (qc) measures was estimated: framewise displacement and relative root mean square dice index. Other qc meaure include dice and jaccard indices, cross-correlation and coverage that estimate the coregistration quality of ASL and T1W images and normalization quality of ASL to template. Quality evaluation index (QEI) was also computed for CBF <span class="citation" data-cites="dolui2017automated">(S. A. N. Sudipto Dolui Ronald Wolf 2016)</span>. The QEI is automated for objective quality evaluation of CBF maps and measured the CBF quality based on structural similarity,spatial variability and the percentatge of voxels with negtaive CBF within Grey matter All resamplings can be performed with <em>a single interpolation step</em> by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using <code>antsApplyTransforms</code> (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels <span class="citation" data-cites="lanczos">(Lanczos 1964)</span>. Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using <code>mri_vol2surf</code> (FreeSurfer).</p>
<p>Many internal operations of <em>aslprep</em> use <em>Nilearn</em> 0.6.2 <span class="citation" data-cites="nilearn">(Abraham et al. 2014, RRID:SCR_001362)</span>, mostly within the functional processing workflow.

Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing
performed using *aslprep* 0.2.3,
which is based on *Nipype* 1.5.0
(@nipype1; @nipype2; RRID:SCR_002502).

Anatomical data preprocessing

: A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input
BIDS dataset.The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU)
with `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4], distributed with ANTs 2.3.1 [@ants, RRID:SCR_004757], and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a *Nipype* implementation of
the `antsBrainExtraction.sh` workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs
as target template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `fast` [FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, RRID:SCR_002823,
@fsl_fast].
Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through
nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration` (ANTs 2.3.1),
using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.
The following template was selected for spatial normalization:
*ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c* [@mni152nlin2009casym, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym],

Functional data preprocessing

: For each of the 1 ASL runs found per subject (across all
tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed.
First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated
 using a custom
methodology of *fMRIPrep*.
Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference
(transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation
parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using
`mcflirt` [FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, @mcflirt].
The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using
`flirt` [FSL 6.0.3:b862cdd5, @flirt] with the boundary-based registration [@bbr]
cost-function.
Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account
for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference.
The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied)
were resampled onto their original, native space by applying
the transforms to correct for head-motion.
These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as *preprocessed
BOLD in original space*, or just *preprocessed BOLD*.
The CBF was quantified from  *preproccessed* ASL data using a relatively basic
model [@detre_perfusion_1992] [@alsop_recommended_2015]. CBF are susceptible to artifacts
due to low signal to noise ratio  and  sensitivity to  motion, Structural Correlation
based Outlier Rejection (SCORE) algothim was applied to the CBF to discard few extreme
outliers [@dolui2017structural]. Furthermore,Structural Correlation with RobUst Bayesian (SCRUB)
algorithms was applied to the CBF by iteratively reweighted  CBF  with structural tissues
probalility maps [@dolui2016scrub].  Alternate method of CBF computation is Bayesian Inference
for Arterial Spin Labeling (BASIL) as implmented in FSL which is  based on Bayeisan inference
principles [@chappell2008variational]. BASIL computed the CBF from ASL incoporating natural varaibility
of other model parameters and spatial regularization of the estimated perfusion image. BASIL
also included correction for partial volume effects [@chappell_pvc].
The ASL and CBF dreivatives  were resampled into standard space,
generating a *preprocessed ASL and computed CBF in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space*.
First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated
 using a custom
methodology of *fMRIPrep*.
Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
*preprocessed ASL*: framewise displacement (FD) and DVARS.
FD and DVARS are calculated for each ASL run, both using their
implementations in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also
placed within the corresponding confounds file.

The following quality control (qc) measures was estimated: framewise displacement and relative
root mean square dice index. Other qc meaure include dice and jaccard indices, cross-correlation
and coverage that estimate the coregistration quality of  ASL and T1W images and  normalization
quality of ASL to template. Quality evaluation index (QEI) was also computed for CBF [@dolui2017automated].
The  QEI is  automated for objective quality evaluation of CBF maps and measured the CBF quality
based on structural similarity,spatial variability and the percentatge  of voxels with  negtaive
CBF within Grey matter
All resamplings can be performed with *a single interpolation
step* by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion
transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available,
and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces).
Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using `antsApplyTransforms` (ANTs),
configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing
effects of other kernels [@lanczos].
Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using `mri_vol2surf`
(FreeSurfer).



Many internal operations of *aslprep* use
*Nilearn* 0.6.2 [@nilearn, RRID:SCR_001362],
mostly within the functional processing workflow.
For more details of the pipeline, see [the section corresponding
to workflows in *aslprep*'s documentation](https://aslprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html "aslprep's documentation").
