# Contributing to *ASLPrep*

Welcome to the *ASLPrep* repository!
We're excited you're here and want to contribute.

**Imposter's syndrome disclaimer**[^1]: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that
you're not ready to be an open-source contributor; that your skills
aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a
project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can
write code at all, you can contribute code to open-source. Contributing
to open-source projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding
skills. Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good developer (that
would disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something, making
mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve,
and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open-source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either.
You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving
feedback about the project (and yes - that includes giving feedback
about the contribution process). Some of these contributions may be the
most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the
project with fresh eyes, so you can see the errors and assumptions that
seasoned contributors have glossed over.

  1. The tool only and fully supports BIDS 
  1. The ASL is not fully supported by BIDS as of now, it is in [progress](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tnn5F10KpgHypaQJNNGiNKsni9035GtDqJzWqkkP6c/edit#). A simple tool has been developed to convert ASL to BIDS format, [aslbids](https://github.com/PennLINC/aslbids).
  1. The tool is rigorously restricted to ASL preprocessing and CBF computation, including (but not limited to):
  1. The tool is thoroughly and transparently documented (including the generation of individual reports
     that can be used as scaffolds for understanding the underpinnings and design decisions of the tool).
  1. The tool is community-driven, with a very open concept of contribution that is always credited
     with authorship offers when writing relevant papers.

## Practical guide to submitting your contribution

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below,
please let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/PennLINC/aslprep/issues)!


* [Contributing through Github](#contributing-through-github)
* [Making a change](#making-a-change)
* [Licensing](#licensing)

## Contributing through GitHub

Every project on GitHub uses [issues](https://github.com/PennLINC/aslprep/issues) slightly differently.

The following outlines how the *ASLPrep* developers think about these tools.

* **Issues** are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forward.
A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that
is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.


## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to *ASLPrep*,
but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

1. **Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**<br />
  This allows other members of the *ASLPrep* development team to confirm that you aren't
  overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page
  with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

### Contributors

Contributors are people that are 
actively help or have previously helped the project in a broad sense: writing code, writing documentation,
benchmarking modules of the tool, proposing new features, helping improve the scientific
rigor of implementations, giving out support on the different communication
channels and GitHub issues etc..
