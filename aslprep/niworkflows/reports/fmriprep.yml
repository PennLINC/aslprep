    caption: The dataset contained some fieldmap information, but the argument <code>--force-syn</code>
      was used. The higher-priority SDC method was used. Here, we show the results
      of performing SyN-based SDC on the EPI for comparison.

      space to T1 Space - BBR refinement rejected. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation
      is used in the reportlets in order to highlight potential spin-history and other
      artifacts, whereas final images are resampled using Lanczos interpolation.

      tissue segmentation) was used for BBR. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation

      CSF and white-matter mask for extracting physiological and movement confounds.
      <br />The fCompCor mask (blue contour) contains the top 5% most variable voxels
      within a heavily-eroded brain-mask.

    caption: The cumulative variance explained by the first k components of the
      <em>t/aCompCor</em> decomposition, plotted for all values of <em>k</em>.
      The number of components that must be included in the model in order to
      explain some fraction of variance in the decomposition mask can be used
      as a feature selection criterion for confound regression.

    caption: Summary statistics are plotted, which may reveal trends or artifacts
      in the asl data. Global signals calculated within the whole-brain (GS), within
      the white-matter (WM) and within cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) show the mean asl
      signal in their corresponding masks. DVARS and FD show the standardized DVARS
      and framewise-displacement measures for each time point.<br />A carpet plot
      shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask. Voxels are grouped
      into cortical (blue), and subcortical (orange) gray matter, cerebellum (green)
      and white matter and CSF (red), indicated by the color map on the left-hand
      side.

      Left: Heatmap summarizing the correlation structure among confound variables.
      (Cosine bases and PCA-derived CompCor components are inherently orthogonal.)
      Right: magnitude of the correlation between each confound time series and the
      mean global signal. Strong correlations might be indicative of partial volume
      effects and can inform decisions about feature orthogonalization prior to
      confound regression.
