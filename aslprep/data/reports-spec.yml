    caption: This panel shows the template T1-weighted image (if several T1w images
      were found), with contours delineating the detected brain mask and brain tissue
      segmentations.

    caption: Spatial normalization of the T1w image to the <code>{space}</code> template.
    description: Results of nonlinear alignment of the T1w reference one or more template
      space(s). Hover on the panels with the mouse pointer to transition between both
      spaces.

  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: fieldmap, suffix: asl}
    caption: The estimated fieldmap was aligned to the corresponding EPI reference
      with a rigid-registration process of the magintude part of the fieldmap,
      using <code>antsRegistration</code>.
      Overlaid on top of the co-registration results, the displacements along the
      phase-encoding direction are represented in arbitrary units.
      Please note that the color scale is centered around zero (i.e. full transparency),
      but the extremes might be different (i.e., the maximum of red colors could be
      orders of magnitude above or below the minimum of blue colors.)

    subtitle: Estimated fieldmap and alignment to the corresponding EPI reference
  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: sdc, suffix: asl}
    caption: Results of performing susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) on the
      EPI

    subtitle: Susceptibility distortion correction
  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: forcedsyn, suffix: asl}
    caption: The dataset contained some fieldmap information, but the argument <code>--force-syn</code>
      was used. The higher-priority SDC method was used. Here, we show the results
      of performing SyN-based SDC on the EPI for comparison.

    subtitle: Experimental fieldmap-less susceptibility distortion correction
  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: flirtnobbr, suffix: asl}
    caption: FSL <code>flirt</code> was used to generate transformations from EPI
      space to T1 Space - BBR refinement rejected. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation
      is used in the reportlets in order to highlight potential spin-history and other
      artifacts, whereas final images are resampled using Lanczos interpolation.

    subtitle: Alignment of functional and anatomical MRI data (volume based)
  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: coreg, suffix: asl}
    caption: <code>mri_coreg</code> (FreeSurfer) was used to generate transformations
      from EPI space to T1 Space - <code>bbregister</code> refinement rejected. Note
      that Nearest Neighbor interpolation is used in the reportlets in order to highlight
      potential spin-history and other artifacts, whereas final images are resampled
      using Lanczos interpolation.

    subtitle: Alignment of functional and anatomical MRI data (volume based)
  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: flirtbbr, suffix: asl}
    caption: FSL <code>flirt</code> was used to generate transformations from EPI-space
      to T1w-space - The white matter mask calculated with FSL <code>fast</code> (brain
      tissue segmentation) was used for BBR. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation
      is used in the reportlets in order to highlight potential spin-history and other
      artifacts, whereas final images are resampled using Lanczos interpolation.

  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: bbregister, suffix: asl}
    caption: <code>bbregister</code> was used to generate transformations from EPI-space
      to T1w-space. Note that Nearest Neighbor interpolation is used in the reportlets
      in order to highlight potential spin-history and other artifacts, whereas final
      images are resampled using Lanczos interpolation.

  - bids: {datatype: asl, desc: carpetplot, suffix: asl}
    caption: Summary statistics are plotted, which may reveal trends or artifacts
      in the asl data. Global signals calculated within the whole-brain (GS), within
      the white-matter (WM) and within cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) show the mean asl
      signal in their corresponding masks. DVARS and FD show the standardized DVARS
      and framewise-displacement measures for each time point.<br />A carpet plot
      shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask. Voxels are grouped
      into cortical (blue), and subcortical (orange) gray matter, cerebellum (green)
      and white matter and CSF (red), indicated by the color map on the left-hand
      side.
